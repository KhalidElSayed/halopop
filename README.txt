This is the public, open source, repo for Jacob and Luke Klinker's HaloPop app.

This app was created to extend the functionality of any custom ROM running halo and give users the option to automatically open apps in the floating window when the notification pings for apps they have selected for auto-open.

HaloPop was designed to be used on android 4.3 Jellybean and nothing lower because of the new notification listener API's that have been included in Google's latest version of its flagship operating system.

This project has been open sourced to help new and up-and-coming developers learn how to use some of Google's new API's and look at some other basic tasks that are possible with Android.

To get started, make a clone of this repo in a directory of your choice, then open the project in your favorite IDE (my IDE of choice is Android Studio). After going through the initial setup, building it to your phone is as easy as clicking the usb debug button and letting it run!

We will update whenever we get the chance to fix any bugs or think of a new idea to put in. To get these changes from the GitHub server, run a git pull when you have cd'd to the folder that you initialized the repo to.

Hope this helps some people, I know we had a lot of fun making it!
- Luke and Jacob Klinker
